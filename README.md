## How to use WinInet FTPCommand function from Visual Basic


</div>

### Description

The Microsoft Win32 Internet Application Programming Interface (WinInet) allows you to quickly create Internet-aware applications using a wealth of functions for working with HTTP, FTP, and Gopher protocols. Without the WinInet, you would be overwhelmed with having to know the specifics of HTTP, TCP/IP, FTP, Windows® Sockets, and so on. Fortunately, the WinInet API makes life significantly easier.

Althougt there is a good documentation for almoust all WinInet functions, description of the FTPCommand function is very limited. This article provides some background information and shows you how to use this powerful function. A sample application (called VBFTPCommand) implements FTP connection, download, and upload using the WinInet FTP functions (including FTPCommand) from Visual Basic. You can do exciting things with FTPCommand, so I encourage you to read on for some ideas and examples of what can be done.
